      <h1 id="policy-title">Privacy Policy for SkyRoute</h1>
      <div class="meta">Effective date: <strong>November 26, 2025</strong></div>

      <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>SkyRoute</strong> ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, discloses, and protects information when you use our mobile application available on Google Play (the "App"). By downloading or using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect the following categories of information to provide and improve the App’s core features (maps, weather, air quality index, and search):</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> Precise or approximate location when you use map, navigation, or weather features. We request location permission and only use this data when you grant permission.</li>
        <li><strong>Device & Usage Information:</strong> Device model, operating system version, app version, unique device identifiers (advertising ID or similar), crash logs, and usage analytics to improve performance and reliability.</li>
        <li><strong>Search Queries & Map Interactions:</strong> Terms you search, places you view, and routing requests to provide search results and personalized suggestions.</li>
        <li><strong>Weather & AQI Data:</strong> We retrieve weather and air quality information from third‑party providers. The specific data collected depends on the provider (temperature, humidity, pollutant levels, forecast data, etc.).</li>
        <li><strong>Optional Account Information:</strong> If you create an account (optional), we collect your name and email address.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
      <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To provide and operate maps, routing, local search, weather forecast, and AQI information.</li>
        <li>To personalize content and search results based on location or preferences.</li>
        <li>To analyze and improve the App, fix bugs, monitor usage, and create aggregated analytics.</li>
        <li>To send transactional messages such as account verification or important updates (if you register an account).</li>
        <li>To comply with legal obligations and protect our rights.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Legal Basis for Processing (Where Applicable)</h2>
      <p>For users in jurisdictions that require a legal basis for processing personal data (such as the EEA), our legal bases include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Consent: for optional features like personalized suggestions or non-essential analytics.</li>
        <li>Contractual necessity: to provide the features you request (e.g., routing, location-based weather).</li>
        <li>Legitimate interests: for improving and securing the App, provided those interests are balanced against your rights.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Sharing & Disclosure of Information</h2>
      <p>We may share or disclose information in the following situations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> Third‑party vendors who perform services on our behalf (e.g., cloud hosting, analytics, push notifications, weather/AQI data providers). These vendors are contractually bound to protect your data.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> When required by law or to respond to valid legal requests from public authorities.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, financing, or sale of assets.</li>
        <li><strong>Aggregated/Anonymized Data:</strong> We may share aggregated, non‑identifying information publicly or with partners.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Third‑Party Data Providers</h2>
      <p>SkyRoute uses third‑party APIs and services to provide map tiles, place search, routing, weather, and AQI data. Each provider may collect and process data as described in their privacy policies. We encourage you to review those providers’ privacy statements for details.</p>

      <h2>6. Advertising & Analytics</h2>
      <p>We may use analytics services to measure app usage and performance. These services may use cookies or similar technologies and collect device identifiers. If we display ads in the future, we will disclose the ad providers and explain how you can opt out of targeted advertising (if available).</p>

      <h2>7. Location Permissions</h2>
      <p>The App asks for location permissions to provide location‑based services such as nearby searches, routing, weather at your location, and AQI. You can choose to grant either approximate (coarse) or precise (fine) location access. You may revoke location permissions at any time in your device settings — doing so may limit some features.</p>

      <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to provide the App’s services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. Aggregated or anonymized data may be retained indefinitely.</p>

      <h2>9. Security</h2>
      <p>We use reasonable technical, administrative, and organizational measures to protect data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure — please take care with the information you provide.</p>

      <h2>10. Children</h2>
      <p>The App is not directed at children under 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you become aware that a child under the applicable age has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will take steps to delete such information.</p>

      <h2>11. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights including access, correction, deletion, restriction of processing, data portability, and the right to object to certain processing. To exercise these rights, please contact us using the details below.</p>

      <h2>12. How to Contact Us / Data Requests</h2>
      <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, wish to exercise your rights, or request deletion of your data, contact:</p>

      <h2>13. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Effective date" at the top. Continued use of the App after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

      <h2>14. Play Store Requirements & Declarations</h2>
      <p>To comply with Google Play policies, we declare the following (if applicable):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We request location permission for core functionality (maps, routing, location‑based weather).</li>
        <li>We do not sell personal information.</li>
        <li>If we use analytics or advertising SDKs, they are disclosed and listed in the App's Play Console declarations.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="note">
        <strong>Note:</strong> Replace placeholders (company name, support email, address, and effective date) with your actual details before publishing. If you use specific third‑party SDKs (analytics, ads, maps), list them in the Play Console privacy declarations and in this policy.
